App that shows random weather statuses


Since Michigan natives joke about the unpredictable weather, I made this weather app that provides inaccurate and unpredictable weather information using sensors. This is a fun personal project to learn about app development, Java and Android Studio.


Weather Statuses

Cloudy: Uses the light sensor to give a brightness value every second and changes the visibility of the sun icon

Rainy: Changes the size of the rain icon

Snowy: Moves the snow icon and can be reset when button is activated

Stormy: Vibrates three times at different intervals when button is activated

Sunny: Provides a random temperature when button is activated.
