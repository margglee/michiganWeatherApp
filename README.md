App that shows random weather statuses

Since Michigan is known for its unpredictable weather, I made this weather app that provides inaccurate and unpredictable weather information using sensors. This is a fun personal project to learn about app development, Java and Android Studio.

Weather Status
Sunny: Provides a random temperature when the sun icon is activated.
Cloudy: Uses the light sensor to give a brightness value every second.
